# Market Research and Analysis
Though other *Augmentative and Alternative Communication* (AAC) evaluations exist, we’ve noticed that these tests are either:
  - Traditional (paper exam)
  - Are applications that require expensive hardware(iPad, along with app fee)
  - Annual subscription fee for an app. ($60+/year)
  - Outdated applications that don’t address customer needs
# Goals
Our goal at XGridZ is to provide a proper application that is easily accessible, maintainable and most importantly, accurate at assessing students in an interactive and engaging way.
  - Give accurate and reliable testing scores that truly reflect the students performance
  - Present the data in a clean and easily understandable/downloadable format for the instructor to review
  - Provide a friendly and inviting application that does not feel like a test for the student
  - Make the app accessible to account for a various amount of disabilities a student may or may not have
  - Create an app that is readily available and accessible, which is why we are using technology like Flutter which can support iOS and Android apps
  - Create an app that has tons of customizable features like text to speech pace, font resizing, photo resizing, etc.
